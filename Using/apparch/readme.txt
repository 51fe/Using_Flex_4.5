The sharedFormatters and myFormatters directories, and the classes in those directories, are checked in only so that the ComponentNamespaces.mxml application can compile and run. The contents of the sharedFormatters/SharedFormatter2.mxml and myFormatters/PriceFormatter.mxml does not appear in the book so they do not have to follow normal conventions (or, in this case, they do not have to do or show anything useful).
